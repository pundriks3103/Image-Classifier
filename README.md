# Description
Image classification is the process of taking an input (like a picture) and outputting a class (like “cat”) or a probability that the input is a particular class (“there’s a 90% probability that this input is a cat”).

Image Classification can be solved with the help of a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). A CNN usually have:

1. Convolutional Layers
2. ReLU Layers
3. Pooling Layers
4. Fully connected Layers

# Example on Dataset

Go through the [Cat_Dog_usingCNN](https://github.com/pundriks3103/Image-Classifier/blob/main/Cat_Dog_usingCNN.ipynb) notebook to see the solved problem.
